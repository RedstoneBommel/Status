# Status Datapack by RedstoneBommel
-------------------------------------------------
With this Status Datapack you easily could show your Server Members your activity  status.

To set a Status use the `/trigger` command:

If you have set a new status, it will look like this:
![2024-08-16_12 44 40](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c79685e-100b-4675-9fd0-aace794f1d8d)


To remove any Status, you must run the command `/trigger none`.

No player needs any rights to execute the commands of my status data pack, making it ideal for survival multiplayer servers.
